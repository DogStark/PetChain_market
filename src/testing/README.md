# Testing Infrastructure for NestJS Project

This directory contains the comprehensive testing infrastructure set up for the NestJS project using Jest. Below are the details of the files and their purposes.

## Directory Structure

- **jest.config.js**: Configuration settings for Jest, including test environment setup, coverage thresholds, and module name mappings.
  
- **test-setup.ts**: Responsible for setting up the testing environment, including any necessary global configurations or initializations required before tests run.

- **test-database.config.ts**: Configuration for the test database, including connection settings and any necessary migrations or seed data for testing purposes.

- **factories/user.factory.ts**: Exports a function or class that creates user objects for testing, providing a way to generate mock user data with predefined attributes.

- **utils/auth.helper.ts**: Exports utility functions related to authentication, such as generating tokens or validating user credentials, which can be used in tests.

- **auth/auth.module.spec.ts**: Contains unit and integration tests for the authentication module, including test cases that verify the functionality of authentication-related features.

- **scripts/run-tests-ci.sh**: A shell script designed to run tests in a CI/CD environment, including commands to execute Jest tests and generate coverage reports.

- **coverage/**: This directory is generated by Jest and contains the coverage reports for the tests, detailing which lines of code were executed during testing.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that Jest and any necessary testing libraries are installed in your project.

2. **Configure Test Database**: Update the `test-database.config.ts` file with your test database connection settings.

3. **Run Tests**: Use the provided scripts to run tests locally or in a CI/CD environment.

4. **Check Coverage Reports**: After running tests, check the `coverage/` directory for detailed coverage reports.

## Testing Strategy

The testing infrastructure is designed to ensure that all components of the NestJS application are thoroughly tested. Unit tests are used to verify individual components, while integration tests ensure that components work together as expected. The authentication module has been prioritized for testing to ensure security and functionality.

## CI/CD Integration

The provided `run-tests-ci.sh` script is designed to be CI-friendly, allowing for seamless integration into your CI/CD pipeline. Ensure that this script is executed as part of your build process to maintain code quality and reliability.
